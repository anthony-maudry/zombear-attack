# Zombear Attack <Unity Survival Shooter Tutorial Enhanced>

This game is a learning tool for the [Unity](https://unity3d.com) engine. I started that project following a the [Survival Shooter Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-tutorial).

v1.0 enhanced the tutorial with some menu panel to quit and restart the game and control the musique.

Lastest versions will add new features to make the game a bit more funky.

For now this project is only for me to learn. I share it because I see no reason not to do it. I wrote most of the C# code and created some other assets but the 3D objects and textures as most of the materials and animation are a great work from the Unity team.

I shared it throught the MIT licence but if it won't match with Unity's assets so please let me know I will update the licencing.

The build is only made for Windows, I project to build on other plateforms, but for convenience it won't be done now. Feel free to download the builded game [here](https://github.com/anthony-maudry/zombear-attack/releases/tag/v1.0). Althought I wonder why you would want to. It's way more funny to follow the tutorial to create your own.
